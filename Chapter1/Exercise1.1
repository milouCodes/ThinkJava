1. A statement is a line of code that performs a basic operation. A comment is a bit of text that explains the code. When the compiler sees //, it ignores everything from there until the end of the line. Comments have no effect on the execution of the program, but they make it easier for other programmers (and your future self) to understand what you meant to do.

2. Portable means they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications.

3. This means that the entire program gets read and translated completely before the program starts running.

4. The executable is the output of the compiler, after translating the program. It's used as a noun because it is used to identify a thing and not an action.
